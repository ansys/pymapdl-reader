Plot nodal displacement for result ``(2, 2)``, which corresponds to
the load step and sub step in fortran indexing.  You could have also
used the python cumulative index 3.

Extract the nodal elastic strain for the fourth cumulative result.
Because pymapdl-reader uses zero based indexing, we have to input "3" here.

Depending on the version of ANSYS, MAPDL either does or does not
write the duplicate sector for a result.  If MAPDL does not write a
duplicate sector, pymapdl-reader will search for a duplicate mode and use
that as the duplicate sector in order to be able to expand to the
full rotor.  Regardless of if there is or isn't a duplicate sector,
only the master sector will be output.

.. warning::
    Cyclic results extracted from pymapdl-reader may disagree with MAPDL
    due to several issues/variations when extracting cyclic results
    within MAPDL using ``PowerGraphics``.  By default, MAPDL uses
    ``\EDGE,,,45``, which disables averaging across surface features
    that exceed 45 degrees, but only writes one value when outputting
    with ``PRNSOL``.  On the other hand ``pymapdl-reader`` always averages,
    so you will see differences between MAPDL and ``pymapdl-reader`` in
    these cases.

Plot the nodal elastic strain in the "Z" direction for result ``(5, 2)``.

``pymapdl-reader`` can plot the displacements while also plotting the
stress/strain.  Since modal results may or may not be normalized,
you will have to adjust the ``displacement_factor`` to scale up or
down the displacement to get a reasonable looking result.  Disable
plotting the displacement by setting ``show_displacement=False``.

Additionally, you can also save screenshots by setting
``screenshot`` to a filename with
``screenshot='elastic_strain.png'``.  If you wish to do this without
manually closing the plotting screen, set ``off_screen=True``.  This
can help you automate saving screenshots.

Plot the nodal elastic stress in the "Z" direction for this rotor.
Since this is plotting the other pair of modes for the 5th loadstep,
the displacement of this response is 90 degrees out of phase of
result ``(5, 2)``

Available stress components are ``['Y', 'Z', 'XY', 'YZ', 'XZ']``

You can also plot the nodal von mises principal stress.  This plot
